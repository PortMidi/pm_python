PyPortMidi
----------

PyPortMidi is a Python wrapper for PortMidi. PortMidi is a cross-platform
C library for realtime MIDI control. Using PyPortMidi, you can send and
receive MIDI data in realtime from Python.

Besides using PyPortMidi to communicate to synthesizers and the
like, it is possible to use PyPortMidi as a way to send MIDI messages
between software packages on the same computer. For example, Using
PyPortMidi and MIDI-YOKE on a Windows machine, it is possible to send
realtime MIDI messages between programs on the same computer using
loopback virtual MIDI ports.

PyPortMidi works with Python 3.x and may also work with Python 2.6
